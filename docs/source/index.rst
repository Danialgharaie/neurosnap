   this is a comment block btw
   the search page above doesn't work due to a bug in the theme:
   https://github.com/readthedocs/sphinx_rtd_theme/issues/998

   its not terrible because the rtd_theme has a search bar in the top left
   already. However, if we switch to a different theme, then it might not be the
   case. Also, the search page is pretty standard in sphinx so we should leave
   it in, in case we switch themes or anything.
